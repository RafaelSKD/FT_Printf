# 🎉 ft_printf

Welcome to **ft_printf**, the project where we recreate the functionality of the standard `printf` function but with our own special twist. If you've ever felt like the built-in `printf` was just too mainstream, then this project is for you. Dive into the world of variadic functions and custom format specifiers with us!

## 🧐 Introduction

**ft_printf** is a custom implementation of the `printf` function. It supports a variety of format specifiers and handles them with grace and elegance. The project is crafted with love, sweat, and a bit of C magic by a dedicated student from 42 school. Yes, we do magic here! 🔮

## 🚀 Features

- **Supports standard specifiers**: `%c`, `%s`, `%d`, `%i`, `%u`, `%x`, `%X`, `%p`, and `%%` (No, that last one isn't a typo, it's a percent sign).
- **Custom handling** of unsigned integers and pointers (because we care about all types, even the unsigned ones).
- **Formatted output** with ease (say goodbye to formatting woes).
