🎉 ft_printf

Welcome to ft_printf, the project where we recreate the functionality of the standard printf function but with our own special twist. If you've ever felt like the built-in printf was just too mainstream, then this project is for you. Dive into the world of variadic functions and custom format specifiers with us!

🧐 Introduction
ft_printf is a custom implementation of the printf function. It supports a variety of format specifiers and handles them with grace and elegance. The project is crafted with love, sweat, and a bit of C magic by a dedicated student from 42 school. Yes, we do magic here! 🔮

🚀 Features
Supports standard specifiers: %c, %s, %d, %i, %u, %x, %X, %p, and %% (No, that last one isn't a typo, it's a percent sign)
Custom handling of unsigned integers and pointers (Because we care about all types, even the unsigned ones)
Formatted output with ease (Say goodbye to formatting woes)
Open-source awesomeness (Fork it, star it, love it)
🛠️ Installation
To install and use ft_printf, clone the repository and compile the source files.

This will create a libftprintf.a file which you can link against in your projects. And just like that, you're halfway to printf perfection! 🎉

🎯 Usage
Using ft_printf is as simple as using the standard printf function. Here’s a quick example:

If it doesn't work, don't worry, I have 99 bugs but a printf ain't one. 🐛

🧩 Functionality
Here’s a rundown of the format specifiers supported by ft_printf:

%c : Character
%s : String
%d : Signed decimal integer
%i : Signed decimal integer
%u : Unsigned decimal integer
%x : Unsigned hexadecimal integer (lowercase)
%X : Unsigned hexadecimal integer (uppercase)
%p : Pointer address
%% : Percent sign (No, seriously, it's not a typo)
Behind the scenes, these are handled by a suite of custom functions like ft_putchar, ft_putstr, ft_putnbr, putnbr_u, put_hex, and put_pointer. Because why not reinvent the wheel if you can make it spin faster? 🛞
